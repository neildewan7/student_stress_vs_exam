      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In this project, we explore the relationship between academic stress and
        physiological responses by analyzing data from wearable sensors
        collected during midterm and final exams. Our goal is to uncover how
        cognitive pressure manifests in real time through measurable signals
        such as heart rate (HR) and electrodermal activity (EDA). This work
        helps illustrate the invisible toll of academic pressure and offers
        insight into how stress varies by individual and context.
      </p>

      <p>
        Going into this, we expect there to be an optimum level of stress for
        exam performance. Obviously, if you're too stressed, you can't focus
        properly on the exam and you'll do worse, but we also expect that if you
        go in not stressed at all, your brain won't be able to focus as well and
        won't see the proper 'threat' of the exam to trigger the correct signals
        to your body. Because of this, we expect that there will be a level of
        stress inbetween that you can train your body to perform at, to increase
        your exam performance.

          This line chart shows the average heart rate of students during exams.
          Users can filter by gender group to observe trends across male and
          female students. The time axis spans a 3-hour exam window, and
          hovering reveals minute-level HR details. Design choice: A line chart
          was chosen for its effectiveness in showing temporal trends,
          especially for identifying patterns such as pre-exam spikes or
          post-midpoint plateaus.

          This scatterplot correlates students' average physiological signal
          levels (e.g., EDA or HR) with their performance on exams. Users can
          switch between midterm and final data. Design choice: We used
          scatterplots to investigate possible trends between stress indicators
          and outcomes, encouraging exploration of whether heightened
          physiological response relates to higher or lower academic
          performance.

      <h2>What We Learned</h2>
      <div class="insights-grid">
        <div class="insight-card">
          <div class="insight-icon">💓</div>
          <h3>Heart Rate Patterns</h3>
          <p>
            Heart rate typically spikes near the end of exams, likely reflecting
            time pressure or final effort. Some students show consistent
            patterns across all exams.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="insight-card">
          <div class="insight-icon">⚡</div>
          <h3>Stress Variability</h3>
          <p>
            Female students demonstrated more variability in EDA during finals,
            suggesting different stress coping mechanisms between genders.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="insight-card">
          <div class="insight-icon">🎯</div>
          <h3>Individual Differences</h3>
          <p>
            Physiological responses varied more by individual than by exam type,
            emphasizing personal stress thresholds and coping strategies.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="insight-card">
          <div class="insight-icon">📚</div>
          <h3>The Reality Check</h3>
          <p>
            There's very little correlation between stress levels and exam
            results, meaning unfortunately there is no easy way to get ahead on
            your exams. You're stuck studying hard if you want to do well!

      <h2>Dataset & Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        We used the publicly available
        <a
          href="https://physionet.org/content/wearable-exam-stress/1.0.0/"
          target="_blank"
          >Wearable Exam Stress Dataset</a
        >
        from PhysioNet, which includes continuous recordings of heart rate (HR)
        and electrodermal activity (EDA) collected during real university exams.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Data processing steps included:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Resampling data for consistent time intervals</li>
        <li>Converting timestamps to relative exam time</li>
        <li>Grouping by student and exam type</li>
        <li>Calculating averages and ranges for visualization</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All preprocessing was done in Python using Pandas and NumPy. The
        visualizations were developed with D3.js to support interactivity and
        dynamic exploration.

    <section id="limitations" class="section">
      <h2>Limitations & Considerations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The dataset lacks baseline readings outside of exams, making it
          difficult to compare to "normal" physiological states.
        </li>
        <li>
          Movement artifacts or environmental factors (e.g., room temperature)
          may influence signal accuracy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sample size and demographic variety are limited, so generalizations
          should be made cautiously.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section id="team" class="section">
      <h2>About the Team</h2>
      <p>
        We are a group of students passionate about data storytelling. This
        project was built collaboratively as part of our final visualization
        course assignment.
